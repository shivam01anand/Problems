Lists are Python Implementation of Arrays.
Stack, Q, DQ are abstract data types.
They allow specific actions.
If satisfied, they're it.
Stack? First in, Last out. == Last in, First out. 
Actoins =
    Access first element
    Remove last element
    Add last element

Stack is almost perfectly a list.

Attrition during downturn? probably starts with the new joinee.

Q? First in, First out. 
Movie Theater, Restaurant. 

That's how you perceive it visually, but what are the properties that make something a Q? or rather, behaviour?

MUST be able to ->
    Access front of Q
    Back of Q
    Add el to Q
    Remove el to Q
    Access Q 

Note; It doesn't mention anything about how the Q moves, straight line, or a static front etc.

DQ? Airport line if a person is vv late, he's fast fwded to front. 

A Q where you can add el to front + remove el from back.
